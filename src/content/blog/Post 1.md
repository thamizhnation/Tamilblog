Eelam is a term used to refer to the historical and cultural homeland of the Tamil people who reside in the northern and eastern regions of Sri Lanka. The Tamil people have lived in Sri Lanka for over 2000 years and have developed a rich culture and history that is unique to their region.

However, the Tamil people have faced significant challenges and discrimination from the Sri Lankan government, which has led to a demand for self-determination and autonomy. The concept of Eelam gained prominence in the 1970s when the Tamil people began to demand their rights due to perceived discrimination and marginalization.

The demand for Eelam eventually led to a three-decade-long civil war that resulted in the deaths of over 100,000 people. The conflict pitted the Sri Lankan government against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), a militant group that fought for an independent Tamil state. The LTTE was notorious for its suicide bombings and other terrorist attacks that targeted civilians and military personnel alike.
